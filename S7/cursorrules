Considerations
• Client monitoring must be done with select()
• All shared resources must be protected
• It can be assumed that the server program will be executed before the client
program.
• It can be assumed that the client will always respect the frames and that the
input file format will not contain errors.
• The use of “system” or “popen” functions or similar from the same family is not
allowed.
• All input and output must be done with file descriptors; the use of printf, scanf,
FILE*, getchar, or similar is not allowed.
• All resources must be freed, otherwise the practice will not be considered
unsuitable.
• Connections must be closed as well as possible, also considering unexpected
closures. Hanging connections will not be accepted.
• The output of the program must be identical to that of the statement (see
examples of execution).
• A single S7.c file must be delivered with the names and logins of the group
members commented. Otherwise, the session will not be corrected.
• It must be compiled using the flags –Wall, –Wextra and -lpthread.
• Any session containing warnings or errors will be unsuitable.
